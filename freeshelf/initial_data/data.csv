Learn Python the Hard Way, Zed Shaw, This simple book is meant to get you started in programming. The title says it's the hard way to learn to write code but it's actually not. It's only the "hard" way because it uses a technique called instruction. Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition. This technique works very well with beginners who know nothing and need to acquire basic skills before they can understand more complex topics. It's used in everything from martial arts to music to even basic math and reading skills.,Python,https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ ,2018-11-22
